    "## Dataset preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Quality measure are more about the input and output of the model. We can take the dataset and depending on the way how we divided it, we can measure the quality of our model. One of the common problem that each data scientist has is about how to divide the data set into training and testing data sets. To understand the following equations we need to introduce new designations. Let $L_{n}$ be our training data set of size $n$, $T_{m}$ our testing data set of size $m$, $M_{e}$ the number of misclassified cases, $I$ a function that return 1 if there is a match between predicted and label value and $e(d)$ the error rate of classifier $d$. We use also $X$ and $Y$ sets that we have already explained. We can write the error rate like following:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "e(d)=\\frac{M_{e}}{m}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "It is the opposite to accuracy that is described later in this section. Error rate can be calculated differently depending on which method of data set preparation is used. There are few commonly used approached of how we can handle the training, testing and validation data sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- resubstitution -- R-method,\n",
    "- hold-out -- H-method,\n",
    "- cross-validation -- $\\pi$-method,\n",
    "- bootstrap,\n",
    "- jackknife.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first method is a very simple one. We have the same data set for training and testing. It is not the best solution if we consider to have a solid classifier. The error rate can be written as following:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "e_{R}(d)=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{n}I(d(X_{j};L_{n})\\neq Y_{j}).\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "It means that we calculate the error rate for each element $j$ of our training data set and add 1 for each well predicted case. We need to divide it with $n$ which is the number of elements in the training data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second method is about dividing a data set into two data sets. It can be divided by half or other proportions. One set is our training data set and the second training data set. We can swap those sets and calculate the average of both sets. The error rate can be calculated as following:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "e_{\\tau}(\\hat{d})=\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{j=1}^{m}I(\\hat{d}(X_{j}^{t};L_{n}\\neq Y_{j}^{t}).\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Compared to resubstitution method it uses the testing data set only.\n",
    "Cross-validation is the most common approach. It can be also called as rotation method. We need to divide the data set into $k$ subsets. The elements in each set are randomly chosen. One of those sets are taken as a testing set where the other sets are merged into a  training set. It should be repeated $k$ times for each $k$ subset. The error rate can be calculated like following:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "e_{CV}(d)=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{n}I(\\hat{d}(X_{j};L_{n}^{(-j)}\\neq Y_{j}).\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "A special case is when $k=m$. It means that we have subsets where each consist of just one element. This approach is known as leave-one-out or U-method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrap method can be considered as an extension of resubstitution. The goal is to generate multiple sets from the main set by randomly selection. We use resubstitution method on each set and calculate an average error at the end:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "e_{B}(d)=\\frac{1}{B}\\sum_{b=1}^{B}\\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{n}I(Z_{j}\\notin L_{n}^{\\star b})I(d(X_{j};L^{\\star b}_{n})\\not Y_{j})}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n}(Z_{j}\\notin L^{\\star b}_{n})}.\n",
